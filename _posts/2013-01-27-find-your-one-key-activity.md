Most Apps can do a number of different things but great apps generally only do one thing really well, and that one thing is what we call their 'key activity'.

When you're building an app, you usually set out to solve a users problem and the exact moment where you solve their problem is where you'll find your key activity. It's the point where you provide the most value to a user and the more often you can do that, the more likely they will continue to use your app, pay for it, and tell their friends about it.

## Examples of key activities

Finding your key activity isn't as hard as it sounds. Here are some examples for inspiration to determine yours:

### Project Management
**Value:** Being more productive  
**Key metric:** Closed tickets  
*If people close tickets they're completing work to be done and being productive.*

### Education
**Value:** Learning  
**Key metric:** Videos watched  
*If people continue to watch videos it means they're finding them valuable and most likely learning.*

### Advertising
**Value:** Lead generation (for advertisers)  
**Key metric:** Ad clicks (leads)  
*If people click on ads, advertisers get more leads and go on to buy more advertising.*

### Community Q and A
**Value:** Having a question answered  
**Key metric:** Answers 
*If people get answers to questions then they'll ask more questions.*

### Payments
**Value:** Money in the bank  
**Key metric:** Transactions  
*If users transact money it means they're getting paid, and who doesn't love that?*

### Games
**Value:** Achievement  
**Key metric:** Level up  
*When users level up they're achieving something and they'll be motivated to continue to achievement more.*

### Retail
**Value:** Revenue  
**Key metic:** Sales  
*When a vendor frequently sells goods then they will keep their store open.*
