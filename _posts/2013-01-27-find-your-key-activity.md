The cafe on the left really should be busier. They have friendly staff, music playing in the background and a place to sit while you wait. The cafe on right is filled with pretentious staff, there's no music playing and you stand in the gutter while you wait. But they are packed. And it's because of one thing: they make really good coffee.

When you want a coffee, you want the best coffee on offer. Nothing else matters.

Too often I see apps that do a number of different things and developers start to worry about insignificant features or button colours when what they should be doing is focusing on doing one thing really well.

The key activity of any app is the point where the app provides the most value to the user. Generally this is the exact point where their problem is solved, and the more often you can solve their problem, the more likely they will continue to use your app, pay for it, and tell their friends about it.

## Examples of key activities

Finding your key activity isn't as hard as it sounds. Here are some examples for inspiration to determine yours:

### Project Management
**Value:** Being more productive  
**Key metric:** Closed tickets  
*If people close tickets they're completing work to be done and being productive.*

### Education
**Value:** Learning  
**Key metric:** Videos watched  
*If people continue to watch videos it means they're finding them valuable and most likely learning.*

### Advertising
**Value:** Lead generation (for advertisers)  
**Key metric:** Ad clicks (leads)  
*If people click on ads, advertisers get more leads and go on to buy more advertising.*

### Community Q and A
**Value:** Having a question answered  
**Key metric:** Answers  
*If people get answers to questions then they'll ask more questions.*

### Payments
**Value:** Money in the bank  
**Key metric:** Transactions  
*If users transact money it means they're getting paid, and who doesn't love that?*

### Games
**Value:** Achievement  
**Key metric:** Level up  
*When users level up they're achieving something and they'll be motivated to continue to achieve more.*

### Retail
**Value:** Revenue  
**Key metic:** Sales  
*When a vendor frequently sells goods then they will keep their store open.*
